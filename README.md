# norwood-ecosystem-services
Repository for storing code and data for the analysis of ecosystem service provision using a network framework.

In terms of data, there are lots of different files (sorry about this, I will clean up the Data folder at some point). Below I list the used of the different data files:
1. Original data
   * nore2_aggregated (data from the original Norwood farm network database)
2. Social-Ecological network plot 
   * habitat_edgelist (links between habitats and species)
   * species_edgelist (links between species and species)
   * service_edgelist (links between species and ecosystem services)
   * nodes (node list for the total social-ecological networks
 3. Bayesian network analysis
    * norwood_cleanest_edgelist (clean edgelist aggregated to appropriate habitats)
    * norwood_species-list (clean node list with contributions to ecosystem services)
